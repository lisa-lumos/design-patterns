# 2. The Observer Pattern
Suppose you need to build a weather station app where different display elements will be updated based on the WeatherData object, which tracks temperature, humidity, etc. Moreover, the app needs to be expandable: it needs to allow other developers to create their own display elements. 

The app has three components: the physical weather station that measures the weather data, the WeatherData object that tracks the data from the station and updates the display elements, and the display elements that shows the current weather conditions to the user. We need to design an app that uses the WeatherData object to update the displays.
